# DALI Developer Social Media Challenge - Backend/API

Hi. This is my submission/repo for the backend of the website.

Please use the following links

(Front end repo)[https://github.com/william-toth/DALI-Social-Media-Challenge]

(Netlify hosted app)[https://dali-social-media-challenge.netlify.app/]

(Heroku hosted backend)[https://dali-social-media-api.herokuapp.com]

This backend uses MongoDB for the database, and the API supports `get`, `post`, `put`, and `delete` operations.
