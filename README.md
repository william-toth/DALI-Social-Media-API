# Lab 5 - Platform Api

In this lab, I created a backend and api that my front end form lab 4 is now using!!

## What worked well

This went surprisingly well. The backend and api were not very hard to make. Where I felt I really understood what was happening was creating each function to get, change, delete, etc. each post.

## What didn't

Although seemingly simple, what was difficult was the extra credit portion of implementing the tags as an array. For this, there was a lot of string to array changes. This started on the back end, and I realized I'd need to edit around my whole front end, which took a while.

## Extra Credit

1) Implements the tags portion of the post as an array. This required much manipulation on both the front end and back end, as users enter strings and see strings when editing, but the data is stored as an array. While there is no massive tangible difference as this webapp is now, holding data like tags in an array instead of one long string is incredibly useful because it makes it much easier to add tag functionaity (i.e. links, search by tag, etc.)

## Screenshots

Virtually the same as lab 4 (can't really get the visuals of a backend), to which I have linked the Github [here](https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52-21S/platform-client-william-toth)
